Problem:
You opened fileHandle with "w" (write) mode:

A file opened in write-only mode cannot be read from. Attempting to call .read() on a write-only handle will throw an error like:
EBADF: bad file descriptor, read

How to fix:
If you want to read from "text.txt", open it in read ("r") or read-write ("r+") mode:

Or, only use .read() on handles opened for reading.

Summary:
You cannot read from a file handle opened in write-only mode. Change the mode to "r" or "r+" if you want to read.
