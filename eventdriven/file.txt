In Node.js, event-driven and EventEmitter architecture are core concepts that enable asynchronous and non-blocking programming, especially useful for building scalable I/O-heavy applications like web servers or real-time apps.
��� 1. What is Event-Driven Architecture in Node.js?

Event-driven means your application responds to events, rather than executing code line by line. Events can be:

    User actions (e.g., clicking a button)

    System events (e.g., data received from a network)

    Application-specific signals (e.g., "database connected")

��� Example Workflow:

    Register a listener for an event (on or once).

    Emit the event when something happens (emit).

    The listener function runs in response.

This is the observer pattern in action.
��� 2. What is EventEmitter in Node.js?

Node.js provides a core module called events, and within it, the EventEmitter class forms the backbone of its event-driven system.
Key Methods:
Method	Purpose
on(eventName, listener)	Register a listener for an event
emit(eventName, [...args])	Emit (trigger) an event
once(eventName, listener)	Register a one-time listener
removeListener(eventName, listener)	Remove a listener
��� Example Code:

const EventEmitter = require('events');

const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Registering a listener
myEmitter.on('greet', (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
});

// Emitting the event
myEmitter.emit('greet', 'Prath');

Output:

Hello, Prath!

��� Real-world Use Cases in Node.js
Use Case	Example
HTTP Server	Request and response events
Streams	Events like data, end, error
Custom Apps	Login events, chat messages, task queues
��� Why It's Powerful

    Non-blocking I/O: Instead of waiting, Node.js reacts when the result is ready.

    Scalability: Efficiently handles thousands of connections.

    Clean modular code: Helps decouple functionality using listeners.

⚙️ Custom EventEmitter Example with Class

const EventEmitter = require('events');

class ChatApp extends EventEmitter {
  sendMessage(user, message) {
    this.emit('message', { user, message });
  }
}

const chat = new ChatApp();

chat.on('message', ({ user, message }) => {
  console.log(`${user} says: ${message}`);
});

chat.sendMessage('Luc', 'Hey! This is cool.');
